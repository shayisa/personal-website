  "about": "After more than thirty years leading technical teams and driving business outcomes across the cybersecurity industry — from early network engineering through executive leadership at Fortinet, Palo Alto Networks, and Blue Coat Systems — I've embarked on a new chapter focused on artificial intelligence and its transformative potential.\n\nSince transitioning from corporate leadership, I've built over twenty AI projects spanning agent infrastructure, full-stack platforms, business automation tools, mobile applications, and educational curricula. I apply the same analytical rigor and strategic mindset that defined my corporate career to exploring how AI can reshape business operations, accelerate decision-making, and create new efficiencies — and I remain deeply committed to mentorship and collaboration, helping professionals and organizations navigate this evolving landscape.\n\nI'm currently in a phase of active renewal — selectively engaging in projects that offer unique challenges while investing deeply in my own professional development and the growth of those I mentor. Operating from Southeast Asia, I bring the same intensity and strategic focus to every engagement, proving that impactful work has no fixed address.",
